Why this chart?

For students like me, when you start to learn lessons @school, you will be introduced in some specific languages (ie: C, python, Java, C++ or whatelse...).

But what's the relation between your learning stuff and the real life?
Where will you use these if elif else for while ?

That why I personnaly want to know...
